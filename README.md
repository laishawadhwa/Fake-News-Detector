# Fake News Detector
Fake news Detection using Passive Agression Algorithm.

# Introduction
Using sklearn, a TfidfVectorizer is built on the dataset. Then, a PassiveAggressive Classifier is initialized and the model is fir. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix quantitavely explain how well the model fares.

# Requirements
```sh
pip install numpy pandas sklearn
```
